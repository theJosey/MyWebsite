      <h1 class="display-3" align="center">My Name is Kevin Josey</h1>
        <p class="lead"> I graduated High School in 2014 
          from Rancho Alamitos before I got accepted into Humboldt State University. After four years of hard work I graduated with my Bachelors in Computer Science in May of 2018. From there I took some time off to relax a bit and create this website to better advertise myself, but now Iâ€™m ready to get to work.

      <h3 class="display-3" align="center">Biggest Projects</h3>
        <p> My two biggest projects are based in 
          <a href="https://www.meteor.com"> Meteor </a> which uses 
          node.js to create websites. These websites also use free Bootstrap templates at <a href="https://www.bootswatch.com">Bootswatch</a>. This website is the first of these projects and you can see it's source code on Github <a href="THE GITHUB LINK HERE"> here</a>. The second project relies more on Meteor and was a school project. We were tasked with creating a piece of working software and my group decided to make a simple matchmaking service to find others to play videogames with. We used <a href="https://www.mongodb.com"> MongoDB</a> for our database. The site itself is currently not up but you can view the source for that project <a href="THE GITHUB LINK HERE"> here</a>. My prefered text editor is <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/"> Sublime Text</a>, but of course I'm willing to make a change.

        <p> When it comes to hiring, it's important to know if your 
          new employee will mesh with the workplace, so I figured I'd talk about myself personally on things not coding related. I'm a big Angels and Lakers fan, therefore I participate with several fantasy sport leagues. Otherwise I like to travel, go to the gym, and play videogames in my spare time.
