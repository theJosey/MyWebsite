SORT feature, at least need to be able to hide "Complete Issues", Ideally also sort by data created and by PROJECT
SORT menu inbetween the issue creatation and issue list would be best, look up examples online
Also need to make create issue look better, maybe with dropdown feature for PROJECT tab. 

Focus on sort first. 

Monday:

sort menu should have dropdowns to determine what to see, with submit button at the end
there is a sort feature for mongo collections! because of  course there is

assign click properties to all checks, have multiple if statements based off said checks, assign var
with the sort function needed. have it somehow assigned to IssueList??

so we found out about selectors and they work for the new default view, just need to figure out how to 
modify these selectors

Tuesday:

can now view all issues with button check
Sort by date and by project need to be dropboxes that work together
work on dropboxes tomorrow. 


Wednesday: busy today, talked to dad.

Thursday:

lots of sort work done!!!!!!!
Just need to add in a monopoly sorter! Otherwise it works great!!

Friday: 

sick from friday to Wednesday
