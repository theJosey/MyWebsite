May 20 - May 24 2019

Goal is to finish website Issue implementation by Wednesday.
Then thursday start on planning for Monopoly. 

Monday: 

Can now add and subtract hours from a issue
Status bar will signify if Issue has been started, not yet started depending on the hours logged
Status will show as Complete if checkbox is marked, when marked complete, can still log hours without changing status
Should probably make the checkbox into a Mark Complete Button. do that tomorrow

Tuesday:

Complete Issue is now a button
Have changed css so Buttons are different colors
Buttons have been moved to appropriate lines, right side of screen is done

Wednesday: 

Goal today is to make left side look nicer, maybe improve 
Didn't do much, just bolded the bits of the left side. 


Thursday: will be at Disney, so day off

Friday: 

Let's spend today planning for next week because I was tired today.....

SORT feature, at least need to be able to hide "Complete Issues", Ideally also sort by data created and by PROJECT
SORT menu inbetween the issue creatation and issue list would be best, look up examples online
Also need to make create issue look better, maybe with dropdown feature for PROJECT tab. 

Focus on sort first.
